# OsmiumRS
Since discord.py is shutting down, and I want to move on anyways, I have decided to move Osmium to Rust.
This will include all of the [discord.py commands](https://github.com/Stereo528/Osmium/tree/Rewrite/commands) I had.

That being said:
## Commands
- About: About the bot.
- Ask: links to https://dontasktoask.com, however I may create a custom site to go along with this thats less... passive aggressive.
- Flip: Flip up to 25 coins.
- Headcrab: throw a headcrab at someone.
- Help: Custom Help Layout.
- Nickname: Rename someone.
- Profile: View info about yourself or someone else, such as what roles they have, or when they joined a server.
- Purge: Purge up to 100 messages at a max of 2 weeks old
- Roll: Roll up to 50d200 dice.
- Serverinfo: See info about a server, like when it was created or how many nitro boosters.
- Slowmode: Adjust the slowmode of a channel.
